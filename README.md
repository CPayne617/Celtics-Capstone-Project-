# Celtics-Capstone-Project-
Final Project
In this project I used VS Code, Spring Tool Suite 4, & MySQL. I implemented CRUD in my project, along with Bootstrap, and RESTful API. I originally wanted to implement this into my MOD 2 Celtics project, and will be a later goal, but for this due date I just wanted to complete the assignment. I also want to add my own api which from my mod 2 Celtics project to only be able to add Celtics players, as of now you can just add any name. I also want to cap the limit of players added to 5 for the starting 5 players.
